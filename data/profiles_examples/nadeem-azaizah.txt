About
Senior Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | AI Developer

I lead end-to-end data science projects, from ideation and modeling to deployment in production environments. I specialize in building AI/ML solutions using Python across domains such as NLP, recommender systems, anomaly detection, and generative AI, working with text, tabular, and time series data.

I'm particularly passionate about graph-based approaches, with deep expertise in knowledge graphs, graph embeddings, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

🎓 I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the University of Haifa and a PhD in Industrial Engineering and Management from Ariel University. My doctoral research focused on graph-based event correlation and prediction in IT operations, integrating heterogeneous graphs, GNNs, and link prediction techniques.
